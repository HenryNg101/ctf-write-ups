# Warmed Up

## Challenge
> What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

## Hint
> Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

## Solution
Just same as "2Warm" challenge, same converter but different conversion type, use the [link](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html)
, and you got "61". For someone who don't know how it works, read it [here](https://owlcation.com/stem/Convert-Hex-to-Decimal). (Note: The "0x" part of the hex number
, we don't convert that one, that's the start for any hex number, just to indicate a hex number)

## Flag
**picoCTF{61}**
