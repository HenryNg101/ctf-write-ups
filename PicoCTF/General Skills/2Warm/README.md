## Challenge
> Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

## Hint
> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

## Solution
This is just a warm-up challenge, so we only need to convert the number 42 from base 10 to base 2, using this [site](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html)
, and we got "101010". For someone who haven't know how it works, read it [here](https://indepth.dev/posts/1019/the-simple-math-behind-decimal-binary-conversion-algorithms)

## Flag
**picoCTF{101010}**
