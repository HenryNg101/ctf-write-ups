# Bases

## Challenge
> What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

## Hint
> Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution
After have a look at string, and the challenge's name "Bases", I think that this text might be encoded in Base64. If you don't know what is Base64
encoding and how to identify, read it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) and [how to identify base64](https://www.hannesholst.com/blog/technology/how-to-identify-a-base64-encoded-string/)
, I got the result is "l3arn_th3_r0p35", which quite make sense, and that's the result for this challenge.

## Flag
**picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}**
