# First Grep

## Challenge
> Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## Hint
> grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)

## Solution
To solve this challenge, you have to use "grep" command to find the answer that is the flag, because the file is quite long, read it manually takes
lots of time, so this help a lot.
