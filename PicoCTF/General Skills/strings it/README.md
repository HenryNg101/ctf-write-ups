# Strings it

## Challenge
> Can you find the flag in file without running it?

## Hint
> [strings](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings)

## Solution
We have to use "strings" and "grep" command, and [**pipes**](http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html) on Linux to filter readable characters then search for the result. If you don't know what "grep" command is used for
, read it [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep).
