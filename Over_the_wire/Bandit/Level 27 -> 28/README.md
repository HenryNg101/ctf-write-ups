Hmm, interesting. So now I'm working with version control again, which is git. Version control systems are used to track projects, especially when you working as
a team. Github is a big website to store all of those projects on the entire Internet (And also where I'm writing my walkthrough on). So, to clone (or download) a 
project, in case you want to look at other's source code, you just need to use **git clone**. Log in, go to destination that I set before, and I see that there's a README file. README file is also a file
that is used in coding projects as a short document for the project (Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)). Print it out, you got the password 
for next level.
