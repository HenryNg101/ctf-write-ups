For this level, same file in home directory, the only difference is, the filename contains another special character, white spaces (used to seperate parameters in
a command). So, to deal with this, I only need to use backslash before any space (I can type some of beginning chars of the file name, and press Tab for autocomplete),
or, put it in double quotes, and I got the pass.
